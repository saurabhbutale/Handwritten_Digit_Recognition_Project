Create a program that can recognize handwritten digits using machine learning. 
Train a basic classification algorithm, such as a feedforward neural network, on a dataset of handwritten digits (like the MNIST dataset). 
Then, allow users to draw a digit on the screen or input an image, and the AI should predict the digit.
